# Smart Expense Tracker - Machine Learning Project Report
## Project Title: Smart Expense Tracker
## Societal or Industrial Imapct:
This project will have an societal impact by assisting people manage their budget or finances with smart and automated categorizing for each expense.
## Research Questions:
- What is the problem with manual expense tracking?
- Why is smart expense tracking more valuable?          
- How can a machine learning model classify expenses effectively?
## Contributions
1. A Time saving expense tracker
2. Test the accuracy of categorizing
3. Make the expense tracking easier for spending
4. Develop a user-friendly prototype
## Dataset
- Type: Secondary
- Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jg7fujhfydhgc/expenses-2024)
## Methodology
1. Set up libraries
2. Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
3. Split data into training and test sets.
4. Applied 3 machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
5. Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
6. Evaluated performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
