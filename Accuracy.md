# Accuracy

## What is Accuracy?
- In classification problems like ours (categorizing expenses), accuracy measures how many predictions our model got correct out of all predictions made.
- Accuracy = (Correct Predictions) / (Total Predictions)

## Why is it matter?
- Practical use-case: In a Smart Expense Tracker, we want the system to categorize your spending correctly. Example: "Starbucks" as "Food" or "Grab" as "Transport".
- As for our target accuracy for this project is 80% or above.

## Accuracy Results
- Logistic Regression: 0.9405 or 94.05%
- Random Forest: 0.9459 or 94.59%
- SVM: 0.9351 or 93.51%
