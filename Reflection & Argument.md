## Reflection
- All models improved with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Misclassifications occurred in similar categories, suggesting feature overlap.
- Dataset imbalance might affected some predictions.
- Including more features like text descriptions could improve accuracy and make the prediction more accurate.

## Arguments
- Machine learning automates expense categorization, saving users time and reducing manual errors.
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM were chosen for their strong performance on classification tasks.
- GridSearchCV helped fine-tune models for optimal accuracy.
